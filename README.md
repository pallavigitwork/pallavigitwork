# Hey Folks 👋

Welcome to my GitHub home! 

I am Pallavi Sharma, a versatile technologist and entrepreneur with close to two decades 
of experience across multiple roles — from individual contributor and technical product manager 
to scrum master, IP coordinator, and open source advocate. Currently, I'm the Founder of 5 Elements Learning (E-Learning) 
and Mosaic Words (Green Literature Publishing). I am a recognized committer to the Selenium Project. 
I am a published author of several books covering FOSS in Technology, beginner-friendly guides on Selenium, and NightWatch.
I serve as a international speaker, reviewer, and organizer at international conferences focused on Testing, Automation, and AI. 
I'm passionate about writing, reading, travel, nature conservation, and giving back to both society and the environment. 
I believe in #BeKind — starting with self.
